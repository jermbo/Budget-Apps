#Budget App with Vue.js
Here is my Buget App in Vue.js. This is the first of many in my journey to understand different frame works. Over time I will update this with cool new features. Some of the things I want to do is : 

1. Animate the addition and removal of an item
2. Animate the totals as they go up and down
3. Store the data in local storage so you don't have to re-enter everything 
4. Rest items after the first of the monty
5. Allow the ability to set recurring items
6. Add dates when entered
7. Add categories
